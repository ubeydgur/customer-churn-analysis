# Customer Churn Analysis

A machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of customer churn based on demographic, behavioral, and service usage data using various classification algorithms.  
This project aims to classify whether a customer is likely to leave the company using structured business data.  
Several models such as **Random Forest** and **K-Nearest Neighbors** are applied and compared.  
The goal is to find the most accurate and generalizable model through evaluation metrics and hyperparameter tuning.

## Features

- **Data Analysis & Visualization**  
  Explore and visualize relationships between customer features and churn behavior using pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and seaborn.

- **Model Training & Evaluation**  
  Train multiple models (RandomForest, KNN) using scikit-learn and evaluate them using metrics like accuracy and cross-validation scores.

- **Model Optimization**  
  Perform hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV and StratifiedKFold for performance improvement.

- **Evaluation Reports**  
  Generate accuracy scores and cross-validation results to analyze model performance.

## Dependencies
- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  
- scikit-learn
